    "# Decision Tree and Random Forest Project \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we will be exploring publicly available data from [LendingClub.com](www.lendingclub.com). Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We will try to create a model that will help predict this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lending club had a [very interesting year in 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lending_Club#2016), so let's check out some of their data and keep the context in mind. This data is from before they even went public.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. You can download the data from [here](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action) or just use the csv already provided. It's recommended you use the csv provided as it has been cleaned of NA values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are what the columns represent:\n",
    "* credit.policy: 1 if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "* purpose: The purpose of the loan (takes values \"credit_card\", \"debt_consolidation\", \"educational\", \"major_purchase\", \"small_business\", and \"all_other\").\n",
    "* int.rate: The interest rate of the loan, as a proportion (a rate of 11% would be stored as 0.11). Borrowers judged by LendingClub.com to be more risky are assigned higher interest rates.\n",
    "* installment: The monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded.\n",
    "* log.annual.inc: The natural log of the self-reported annual income of the borrower.\n",
    "* dti: The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower (amount of debt divided by annual income).\n",
    "* fico: The FICO credit score of the borrower.\n",
    "* days.with.cr.line: The number of days the borrower has had a credit line.\n",
    "* revol.bal: The borrower's revolving balance (amount unpaid at the end of the credit card billing cycle).\n",
    "* revol.util: The borrower's revolving line utilization rate (the amount of the credit line used relative to total credit available).\n",
    "* inq.last.6mths: The borrower's number of inquiries by creditors in the last 6 months.\n",
    "* delinq.2yrs: The number of times the borrower had been 30+ days past due on a payment in the past 2 years.\n",
    "* pub.rec: The borrower's number of derogatory public records (bankruptcy filings, tax liens, or judgments)."
